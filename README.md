# Advanced Graph Editor

[![Deploy to GitHub Pages](https://github.com/markosalabutin/graph-stuff/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/markosalabutin/graph-stuff/actions/workflows/deploy.yml)

ðŸš€ **[Live Demo](https://markosalabutin.github.io/graph-stuff)**

An interactive, modular React-based graph editor with support for both directed and undirected graphs, weighted and unweighted edges, and comprehensive editing capabilities.

## Features

### Graph Types

- **Directed Graphs**: Create graphs with directional edges (arrows)
- **Undirected Graphs**: Create graphs with bidirectional connections
- **Weighted Graphs**: Assign numerical weights to edges
- **Unweighted Graphs**: Simple connections without weights

### Editing Modes

- **Vertex Mode (V)**: Add vertices by clicking, drag to move
- **Edge Mode (E)**: Create edges by clicking between vertices
- **Delete Mode (D)**: Remove vertices and edges by clicking

### Interactive Features

- **Drag & Drop**: Move vertices around the canvas
- **Visual Feedback**: Real-time preview when creating edges
- **Edge Weight Editing**: Click on edge weights to modify them
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Automatically prevents duplicate edges
- **Graph Conversion**: Seamlessly convert between directed/undirected modes

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- **V** - Switch to Vertex mode
- **E** - Switch to Edge mode
- **D** - Switch to Delete mode
- **G** - Toggle Directed/Undirected graph
- **W** - Toggle Weighted/Unweighted graph
- **ESC** - Cancel edge creation

- **Deployment Status**: Check the badge above for current deployment status
- **Manual Deployment**: The GitHub Actions workflow handles deployment automatically

## Usage Examples

### Basic Workflow
1. **Create Vertices**: Switch to Vertex mode (V) and click to add vertices
2. **Connect Vertices**: Switch to Edge mode (E) and click between vertices
3. **Enable Weights**: Press W to toggle weighted mode
4. **Set Direction**: Press G to toggle directed/undirected mode
5. **Edit Weights**: Click on edge weight numbers to modify them
6. **Delete Elements**: Switch to Delete mode (D) and click to remove
